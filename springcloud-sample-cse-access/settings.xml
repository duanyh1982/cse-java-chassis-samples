  <!-- mirrors | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts 
    from remote repositories. | | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository 
    to use in resolving certain artifacts. | However, this repository may have 
    problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored | it to several 
    places. | | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create 
    a mirror reference for that | repository, to be used as an alternate download 
    site. The mirror site will be the preferred | server for that repository.

    <!-- mirror | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a 
      given repository. The repository that | this mirror serves has an ID that 
      matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used | for inheritance 
      and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.

  <!-- profiles | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a 
    variety of ways, and which can modify | the build process. Profiles provided 
    in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine- | specific paths 
    and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment. 
    | | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus 
    - that needs to know where | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide 
    a variable here such that the variable is | dereferenced during the build 
    process to configure the cactus plugin. | | As noted above, profiles can 
    be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles | section 
    of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially 
    | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular 
    value for the property, | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also 
    be activated by JDK version prefix, where a | value of '1.4' might activate 
    a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'. | Finally, 
    the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line. 
    | | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to 
    specifying only artifact | repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form 
    properties to be used as configuration | variables for plugins in the POM.
